pg 53 - pictures of joint models to clarify which joints I mean for each loading (section 4.3.1.1)
  No current images to refer to.

pg 55 - diagram showing axes and angles and where measurements were taken

///pg 59 - diagram demonstrating trig equations
  use matlab plot. lines from (0,0,0)
  
pg 64 - determine what 3mm means at the distance we are testing

pg 78 - "I think there should be a whole section containing recommendations; you've done a bunch of work and have learned a lot about the design. Some of this could just reference the design guidelines in section 4.3, as those will be somewhat more detailed when you get to this part."

////pg 54 - example design for motor holder with bearings that keep motor out of load path

////pg 57 - need link to matlab code (image processing) also needed on page 70

////Need to add matlab code for relative rotation test

////Need to add matlab code for grid of point testing
