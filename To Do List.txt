3.2 Angle definition images need to be modified
Figure 14: Make '+' signs bigger
3.4 Home position setting: connect to later section on design guidelines (which also needs writing)
3.6.1 Time derivative of a transformation matrix need to put the math here which shows that we need the instantaneous positions
4.2 design guidelines section needs lots of work
  do simple fbd on each spot that needs bearings
  biggest part of the remaining work
  
4.3 Electrical Design
  whole section needs love. not even sure where to go with it
5.2.1.2 Need to generate plot of commanded angle vs cmd-actual (error at each commanded point)
5.2.2 need the results of the velocity testing
5.2.4 wobble section is empty
All testing needs to have conclusions drawn
6.0 Conclusion needs to be written 
  here is what I did
  here are the results
  here is how it can be improved
Appendix A Need to generate doxygen manual
  need to make sure code is in correct format
Appendix B Need to output drawings of any parts I made
