Outline:
Motivation
Math discussion
Design discussion
Testing procedure
Test results
then mech design improvments
I think intro of mech design after testing results is a little out of order. It makes more sense to me to see the design first, then the results of its testing


 I think you have the right basic idea, and
the main topics look good.  I think it's best to emphasize that you've
been working to verify and improve a design methodology, and emphasize
that all this testing has been about the design, not just a testing
thesis -- it will be a lot easier to gain approval from that angle.
Otherwise you might have to explain the above on the fly in response to
questions, a more stressful option.
