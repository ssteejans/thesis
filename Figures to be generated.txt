    lots of photos...but I need to figure out what the hell to do with this section
    
Equations
  3.1
    Each rotation matrix on its own
    Rotation matrices in order of multiplication including the correction matrices
    Correction matrices multiplied in
      Don't multiple all matrices, just the correction into their associated ones
    Full formula: rotation matrix operating on home position
    Distance formula (L = sqrt(...))
  3.2.1
    Time derivative of a transformation matrix
  3.2.2
    Put the theta_new equation vector form with all three angles
    L_new = f() into the full form as seen in end of 3.1.
    stepsPerSec = [in/s]*threadpitch[rot/in]*[steps/rot]
  3.3
    Will need equations showing how latitude, longitude, right ascension, declination, and time -> altitude, azimuth, and rotation.
